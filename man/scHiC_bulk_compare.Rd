\arguments{
\item{norm.hic.table}{A data frame representing a jointly normalized pseudo-bulk Hi-C table output from two conditions, generated by the \code{hic_loess} function.
This should be a pre-processed table that has been jointly normalized before differential analysis.}

\item{D.interval}{A numeric vector defining the distance intervals to consider in the analysis, or a character string 'full' indicating the inclusion of all genomic distances in the analysis. The distance should be scaled by dividing by the data resolution, D = (start2 - start1)/resolution (e.g., D = (16,000,000 - 17,000,000)/1,000,000 -> D = 1).}

\item{fprControl.logfc}{A numeric value controlling the false positive rate by setting the threshold for the log fold change. Detected differences should have a value larger than this threshold.
Default is 0.8.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value for the significance level of outlier detection. Default is 0.05.}

\item{SD}{A numeric value specifying the standard deviation threshold for fuzzing, used to produce a Hi-C matrix from data with few true differences. This value is used to identify the optimal 'A.min' quantile cutoff in the \code{filter_params} and \code{hic_compare} functions for detecting significant outliers. Default is 2.}

\item{numChanges}{An integer indicating the number of changes to add to the Hi-C matrix. This value is used to identify the optimal 'A.min' quantile cutoff in the \code{filter_params} and \code{hic_compare} functions for detecting significant outliers. The number of changes should be proportional to the resolution of the data. High-resolution data should use more changes (e.g., 1MB resolution - 300 changes, 100KB resolution - 1000 changes, etc.). Default is 300.}

\item{FC}{A numeric value representing the fold change threshold added to the Hi-C matrix. This value is used to identify the optimal 'A.min' quantile cutoff in the \code{filter_params} and \code{hic_compare} functions for detecting significant outliers. Default is 3.}

\item{A.min}{A numeric value or NA, specifying the A-value quantile cutoff to filter lower average expression in the \code{hic_compare} function from HiCcompare.
If not provided, an optimized minimum A threshold that maximizes MCC and TPR while minimizing FPR is used.}

\item{Plot}{A logical value indicating whether to plot the differential results in an MD plot. Default is TRUE.}

\item{BP_param}{Parameters for \code{BiocParallel}, to be passed to the \code{bpparam()} function.}

\item{parallel}{A logical value indicating whether to use parallel processing for computations.
Default is FALSE. This option only works on Unix-based operating systems and is useful when analyzing a list of Hi-C tables.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the results of the differential Hi-C analysis, including a normalized report and a
'Difference.cluster' column indicating the clusters of differences identified in the analysis.
}
\description{
This function compares single-cell Hi-C data between two groups using the \code{scHicCompare} differential analysis workflow. It detects chromatin interaction differences between the single-cell Hi-C data of two cell types or conditions.
}
\details{
The \code{BulkHiC_compare} function performs differential chromatin interaction comparisons between single-cell Hi-C data from two cell types groups or conditions. The workflow includes clustering normalized log fold changes between interaction frequencies of 2 cells type at each genomic distance into "difference" and "non-difference" groups. The non-difference group is assumed to follow a normal distribution centered around 0 and is clustered by a Gaussian Mixture Model. The difference cluster consists of points belonging to other distributions. In cases where the size of the differences is not large enough to form distinct distributions, these differences are likely outliers of the normal distribution, which are identified by the \code{hic_compare} function.
