Description: This package provides functions for differential chromatin interaction analysis 
    between two single-cell Hi-C data groups. It includes tools for imputation, normalization, 
    and differential analysis of chromatin interactions. The package implements pooling techniques 
    for imputation and offers methods to normalize and test for differential interactions across 
    single-cell Hi-C datasets.
